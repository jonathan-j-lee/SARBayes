      \subheading{Purpose}

      When conducting wilderness search-and-rescue (WiSAR) operations, speed is critical. Every
      passing hour allows lost persons to move ever further away from their
      last known locations along roads, trails, and waterways. As the
      potentially searchable area expands, the likelihood of a successful find
      drops, and extreme temperatures, hunger, exhaustion, and accidents result
      in fatalities. Therefore, search planners need reliable models of lost
      person motion to determine where to send their teams. Prolonged searches also put search teams into harm's way and strain their
      resources.

      \indent

      A model for describing the probability of survival over time for a given
      subject lost in the wilderness would help address both of these issues.
      Researchers developing motion models may consider survival forecasts when
      predicting how lost persons behave in particular circumstances, and
      search planners may examine the probability of survival to determine when the odds of a successful find are too low to continue searching.

      \indent

      \subheading{Objective}

      The objective of this project was to describe the probability of survival
      as a function of time, denoted here as $S(t)$, given a list of attributes
      about the incident, such as subject age, category, and temperature.

      \indent

      $S(t)$ should have the following properties:

      $$S(0) \approx 1, \lim_{t \to \infty} S(t) = 0$$

      In other words, we assume nearly all subjects start out alive, but
      eventually expire.

      \heading{Methods}

      The data used originate from the International Search \& Rescue Incident
      Database (ISRID) \cite{isrid}, which collects information about real-life
      WiSAR cases.

      \subheading{Model}

      Asking for the probability of survival at a given time is the same as
      asking for the probability the subject will have survived at least
      until that time. In survival analysis, the latter can be written as

      $$S(t) = P(T > t) = 1 - F_T(t) = \int_t^\infty f_T(t) dt$$

      where $T$ is the random variable representing the time of death,
      $F_T(t)$ is the cumulative distribution function of $T$, and $f_T(t)$
      is the probability density function of $T$ \cite{rochford}. To
      approximate the true survival function, we used the Kaplan-Meier
      estimator, given by

      $$S(t) = \prod_{t_i < t} \frac{N_i - d_i}{N_i}$$

      where $t_i$ is the time of every event before $t$, $N_i$ is the number
      of subjects just before $t_i$, and $0 \leq d_i \leq N_i$ is the number of deaths
      at $t_i$.

      \indent

      As shown, the Kaplan-Meier estimator uses the cases themselves to calculate an empirical probability
      of survival, which decreases over time. Such a nonparametric model can adapt to new data well. Also, the
      Kaplan-Meier esimator handles right-censoring, which occurs when subjects are rescued
      and we cannot see when they would have died, had searchers not found them.

      The Kaplan-Meier curves for the four most common categories,
      excluding subjects in groups, are shown above. The $95\%$ credence intervals are
      given by the shaded regions. Survivals
      are indicated by the tick marks.

      \heading{Conclusion}
        As shown, Kaplan-Meier curves fit the data well, and are robust enough
        to handle noisy data. Unlike other models, like logistic curves, the Kaplan-Meier
        estimator can capture a range of survival processes well.
